# HOW TO STYLE RUBY MODE DIFFICILE

* `application.scss` hosts **only reusable stuff**
  * Look for existing CSS classes
  * Look for global variables `$variable-name`
  * Create new classes with **explicit** names !

* Other files are linked with views inside dedicated controller
* They are **not** meant to host **reusable** enough stuff


* / ! \ Please consider writing CSS before thinking about Bootstrap
